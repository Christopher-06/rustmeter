rustmeter is a collection of Rust libraries and macros for monitoring and tracing function execution in embedded systems. It provides tools to instrument functions, capture execution metrics, and trace function calls with minimal overhead. it is designed to work seamlessly with the `embassy` async executor for embedded Rust applications.

this crate contains the main functionality on the controller side. It gathers data via user-defined macros or hooks into async executors like `embassy`.
